                        Dear NVBA Member, <br /><br />

Hope you are enjoying the last days of summer and looking forward to an exciting fall. We, at NVBA, are also on the same page as you. After an active summer, NVBA is gearing up for our annual marquee event, Durga Puja. Hoping that the specter of Covid is behind us for good, we are pulling all the stops to make this up-coming Durga puja a memorable event. <br />
Since the formation of the new Executive Committee at the end of last year, we have been able to host a series of events leading up to the Durga Puja. Our first event was Saraswati puja in February 2022. Still unsure of the impact of Covid at the time, we did all that we could to protect the community and celebrate Saraswati puja at the same time. We introduced drive-by puja for the very first time in NVBA. The response to the new concept was overwhelming. Patrons like you showed up in huge numbers on one of the coldest days of the year. We thank you for that.  Right on the heels of Saraswati Puja we celebrated Poila Boishak at Washington Kali Temple in April. In the third weekend of May, the community came together with our bouquet of cultural tribute for Kobi Pronam. As Bengalis we are always very proud of this unique event in honor of the poets who form the cornerstone of our Bengali culture.  In June, we had our annual picnic, where all our members were invited to a free picnic event for a great day of food, fun and friendship. And now with fall knocking on our door, it is time for Durga Puja. <br />
This year’s Durga Puja’s key attraction is our guest artists line up. One can argue that this is the best 3-day cultural line up in the history of NVBA. After many years, we are back with a Bengali band. Bengali band Chandrabindu with household names like Anindya, Upal and Chandril will grace the stage on Friday, 30th to get the festivities started. And yes Ta-pa-tini will be on tap. On Saturday night we will have Bengal’s favorite duo musical team Sourendro and Soumyajit. The S&S duo will enchant you with their mesmerizing renditions of many songs that you grew up with. On Sunday, we will have the dynamite duo of Shovan Ganguly and Trisha Chatterjee. Shovan, one of the hottest singers, composers and music directors in Bengal today will go all out along with Trisha to make sure the last evening of Puja is scintillating, foot-tapping and utterly memorable. Apart from guest artists we will have a wonderful collection of cultural performances from NVBA’s own artists. With the NVBA community growing every day, we have a great pool of talent in every area of the arts. <br />
Apart from the cultural attractions we will have our regular attractions that you have come to love every year…dedicated puja of our deity and sumptuous food made from scratch by our amazing volunteers. <br />
None of the excitement mentioned above is possible without the whole-hearted participation of the entire community. We are thankful for all the support you have provided us in the past years and this year. Also, this huge task of NVBA Durgotsav is not possible without the Executive Committee members, and tens of volunteers who work days and nights prior to and during the puja days to pull this event through. I am personally thankful to each and every one of you and I feel privileged and honored to serve as the president of an amazing organization called NVBA.
<br />

Sumanta Chakraborty <br />
President
